# Pokemon-list
Getting started:
1: copy all files into a folder.
2:open pokemons.html
Here you can see a list of Pokemons where you can select one from the list or search by name and then click to see the details and statistics in the pokemonsdet.html page.
You can find also a button to compare two Pokemons that can take you to the pokemonsdetcompare.html page.
3. In the pokemonsdet.html page here you can see the details and statistics of the pokemon, add to favourite, view all your favourite pokemons ID list, clear all your favourite pokemons list and go back to the pokemons.html page by clicking in the back button.
4. In the pokemonsdetcompare.html page here you can see the details and statistics of two pokemons of your selection side-by-side by clicking the compare button. Here you can also go back to the pokemons.html page by clicking in the back button.

If you used any frameworks (JS or CSS) why did you choose them? Yes,for more convenient web development.
Did you have any challenges and if so, how did you overcome them? Yes I had difficulties on passing the array through local storage and got over it by investigating on internet.
Did you add any extra features? Yes a simple list with the view of all your favourite pokemons ID, clear all your favourite pokemons from your list and a button to go back to main list page pokemons.html.
If you had more time, what else would you implement? Probably 1 more day to do the pagination to the main pokemons.html page and I would add colors and images of the clientâ€™s preference.
